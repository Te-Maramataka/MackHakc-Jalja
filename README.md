How to use
1. Open up the app through your phone
2. Click on ar / gallery to view them 
3. Input year to get a matariki date 
4. Code can be test through the algorithm.cs or through the app, will need to mess about a little bit, just create a Main/Start function depending on platform

This was made mainly on a few computers, with others helping behind the scenes with code, prefabs, designing, that is why you see a slightly skewed commit page.
Thank you for using our program, we hope you also test out the program by installing the APK!
