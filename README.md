How to use
1. Open up the app through your phone

3. Input year 
4. Code can be test through using either algorithm.cs, will have to messa bout a little bit, just create a Main/Start function depending on platform

This was made mainly on a few computers, with others helping behind the scenes with code, prefabs, designing, that is why you see a slightly skewed commit page.
